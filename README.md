# Project R codes
Here are the analysis codes of my summer internship projects at Innovation Lab, University of Iowa Health Ventures:
1. Examining Seasonality of Recurrent UTIs (Urinary Tract Infections)
2. Time-series Clustering of Fitbit Walking Pattern

## Examining Seasonality of Recurrent UTIs
Building on the lab's previous study on the seasonality of UTI cases, I looked at *recurrent* UTIs cases specifically and examined the seasonlity of recurrent UTIs and the relationship between incidence and weather.

## Time-series Clustering of Fitbit Walking Pattern
To help identify users who are more likely to drop out of an exercise application game, I built a clustering algorithm to classify user's walking pattern on a day-to-day basis. A detailed report on the method is attached in the folder. 

## Note 
Due to confidentiality issues, both datasets are not public. Therefore, only analysis codes and knitted HTML files are available on this repository.
